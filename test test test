Can you see this...?

I was thinking an idea for the main circle... so you know how we need gifs for the GUI... we can use a website and create our own gifs?? 
we'll have to constect the individual pieces of the circle like this, convert into gifs, and then use in coe

ACTUALL nevermind using a website... We can amke the sections on paint3D and save them as gif on there!!
